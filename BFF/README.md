# BFF Service (Backend for Frontend)

The **BFF Service** (Backend for Frontend) provides a **simplified and optimized API layer** for the frontend.  
It aggregates data from multiple backend microservices, orchestrates workflows, and transforms responses into a frontend-friendly format.

This service is the main entry point for the frontend application and communicates directly with other microservices in the **Virtual Bank System**.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Responsibilities
- **Aggregate Data**: Collect and combine responses from multiple microservices into a single response.
- **Orchestrate Business Flows**: Handle workflows that involve multiple services.
- **Data Transformation**: Adapt and reshape backend data for frontend needs.
- **Service Communication**: Use asynchronous calls (`WebClient`) to fetch data efficiently.

Fetches **user profile**, all associated accounts, and recent transactions for each account.
